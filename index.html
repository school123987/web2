<h2>How to get started with Brackets<h2>   
<h2>-And also how to use Adobe Media Encoder<h2>       
<h3>1. How to set up a webpage!</h3> 
    <p>Start off by downloading the Brackets installer from <a href="http://brackets.io/">here.</a> Brackets is an open-source program with which you can code html files. Double-click the installer when it is finished downloading and follow the steps for installing Brackets. Once you've finished all these steps, you can begin to create your webpage.
    <p>The first thing you will wnat to do is copy and paste the HTML example code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">here.</a> After that, type in "Brackets" in the start menu and click it. Go to "File" at the top-right, and then click "New". Under the heading "Working Files", there should be a new file. Rename it to index.html. With this done, you can start coding in things you your website.
<h3>How to use Adobe Media Encoder to encode a video for your website.</h3>
<p>Here are some helpful tips to using Adobe Media Encoder.<br>
<p>If you want to, you can reduce the byte size of a video by using some of Adobe Media Encoder's settings. You can do this by opening Adobe Media Encoder and clicking on the top left, at an option named "File". After clicking it, there should appear under it an option called "Add Source". Clicking on it. Find the video you want to reduce the size of and choose the "Open" button at the bottom right. Now inside the Adobe Media application, the video will be there under "Queue", at the top-right. Now right-click on the video and then left-click on export settings. At this point, a new window will open. Now, you can lower the size by lowering some of the numbers' sizes - for example, under video, you can reduce the resolution. Here are a few pictures which may help you with the process, if you're more of a visual learner, or if my instructions were terrible.

<br>After I finished adjusting various settings, like resolution and bitrate, I ended up with 31 MB from a previous size of 51 MB.</p>
